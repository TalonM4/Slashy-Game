The end user will hopefully be someone who would like to try what is traditionally a 
mobile game on a computer. This project is interesting to me because as of late,
I have played many clicker games, and I thought it would be cool to create my own clicker 
game. As well it allowed me to put my own twist on the genre by enabling users to create
and kill their bosses.
